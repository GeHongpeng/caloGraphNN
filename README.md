# caloGraphNN

Repository that contains minimal implementations of the graph neural network layers discussed in [caloGraphNN].
All necessary functions are included in the individual python files. The layers can be used analogously to tensorflow layers. 
Keras wrappers will follow.

When using these layers to build models or modifying them, please cite our paper:
